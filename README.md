# StupidJailbreak
99% guarunteed not to work... 1% might work. This is an attempt at smashing together PhoenixNonce and DoubleH3lix to try to make a 9.3.x jailbreak. I don't have a testing device, so logs would be helpful to fix errors and get it to a working state.

Oh... And I used `make` to build this. It might or might not work in xcode, I don't know, since I only use that for the storyboards, so try at your own risk. And I am 100% not responsible for anything that happens to your device, so you might want to look at the code first (hint: it should be safe, but you never know)
