# StupidJailbreak
99% guarunteed not to work... 1% might work. This is an attempt at smashing together PhoenixNonce and DoubleH3lix to try to make a 9.3.x jailbreak. I don't have a testing device, so logs would be helpful to fix errors and get it to a working state.

Oh... And I used `make` to build this. It might or might not work in xcode, I don't know, since I only use that for the storyboards, so try at your own risk. And I am 100% not responsible for anything that happens to your device, so you might want to look at the code first (hint: it should be safe, but you never know)

Jesus Christ! I need to learn how to finish writing things. Most of this (99% of it actually) is thanks to @Siguza and @tihmstar and @qwertyoruiopz. Without them, I wouldn't even know where to start. Thank you!
